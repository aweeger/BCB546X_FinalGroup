posterior probability distribution, and that diagnostics are calculated every 1,000
generations.

the diagnostics in the mcmc command. The program will output a table with
summaries of the samples of the substitution model parameters, including the
mean, mode, and 95 % credibility interval.

probabilities for each split and a phylogram with mean branch lengths. Both
trees will also be printed to a file that can be read by FigTree (Rambaut and
Drummond, 2012) and other tree-drawing programs, such as TreeView (Page,
1996) and Mesquite
