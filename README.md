# BCB546X_FinalGroup
This repository holds the materials for the completion for The Eclectics group project for BCB546X. 

Our goal was to recreate the findings from Leininger et al. 2014 (see .pdf within).

Within this repository you will find: 
  1. Weeger_et_al2019.md : This introduces the original paper, explaining the technical details of our replication of analyses and summarizes our results from our attempts. 
  2. Jupyter file : Contains the commented work flow code for our replication. 
  3. Data directory : contains links to the data necessary to run our code.
